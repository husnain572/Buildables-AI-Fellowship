    "This report examines how the Australian workforce changed between 1945 and 2000. It highlights four major themes: the rapid rise of women’s workforce participation (especially married women), the influx of migrants and their ongoing employment challenges, the shift from rural and manufacturing work to service-oriented “white collar” industries, and the sharp increase in unemployment linked to demographic and socio-economic factors. Drawing on Australian Bureau of Statistics data and secondary literature, the report frames these shifts as both opportunities (greater diversity, new job sectors) and challenges (displacement by technology, long-term unemployment).  \n",

    "- **Women & Migrants:** Women, especially married women, moved into paid work in unprecedented numbers, while migrants filled post-war labor gaps but often faced high unemployment and low-skill roles.  \n",

    "**1.1 How is prompt chaining similar to solving a jigsaw puzzle?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "***Answer:***  \n",
    "In a jigsaw puzzle, we match each piece based on the one placed before it. Similarly, in prompt chaining, each new prompt is built on the output of the previous one. In this way, both processes are connected and work in a similar manner.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.2 What’s the main difference between *iteration* and *chaining*?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "***Answer:***  \n",
    "Iteration involves refining or tweaking a single prompt multiple times to improve the output, while chaining focuses on linking prompts together, where the output of one prompt becomes the input or foundation for the next. In this way, iteration is about enhancing one idea, whereas chaining is about building a sequence of connected ideas to achieve more complex results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.3 Why might prompt chaining be more effective than asking AI one big question?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "***Answer:***  \n",
    "LLMs operate within a context window, which allows them to use previous responses as a reference. This makes it easier to design prompts that build on earlier outputs. If we provide a completely new prompt each time, the responses may vary and lack continuity, which might not align with our requirements.  \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.4 How can the *context window* of an AI model affect your chaining strategy?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "***Answer:***  \n",
    "The context window has a significant impact on prompt chaining. It allows LLMs to generate more accurate responses based on the history it contains. If the context window is larger, the model can access more information from previous interactions, increasing the chances of producing the desired output.  \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# 1) Use case — short paragraph, users & benefits, limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use case (chosen):**\n",
    "An **IELTS Language Instructor chatbot** that helps students prepare for the IELTS Speaking and Writing modules by correcting grammar, suggesting vocabulary, providing structure for essays, offering sample answers, and giving an approximate band-level estimate with explanation and examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why I chose this:**\n",
    "Many IELTS students need fast, consistent feedback on writing and speaking practice. A chatbot gives immediate corrections and model answers so students can iterate an unlimited number of times, which complements classroom study and one-on-one coaching.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target users:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Self-study IELTS candidates (intermediate → advanced English learners).\n",
    "* Language centers who want a lightweight practice tool for students.\n",
    "* Teachers who want a demo/assistant to produce example tasks and corrections.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Immediate grammar corrections and targeted vocabulary suggestions.\n",
    "* Model responses / sample answers for practice.\n",
    "* Band-estimate plus precise guidance to improve to the next band.\n",
    "* Scalable 24/7 practice without human tutor cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations (what it cannot do):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* It cannot *officially* grade or certify scores — band estimates are heuristic, not official.\n",
    "* It cannot assess spoken pronunciation quality from audio without an integrated STT/TTS pipeline. (Current implementation is text-only.)\n",
    "* It may hallucinate specifics (e.g., invented references) — so users should verify factual claims.\n",
    "* It’s not a replacement for a certified tutor for high-stakes advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2) Justification: Why a chatbot, tasks it performs, and benefits over alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why solve this with a chatbot?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Speed and interactivity: instant feedback is more effective for iterative language learning.\n",
    "* Personalization: can provide targeted grammar/vocab suggestions based on user responses.\n",
    "* Cost-effective scaling: can serve many learners simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it improves the experience vs website/app/human-only:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compared to static web pages: interactive, reactive, and able to adapt to user content and mistakes.\n",
    "* Compared to an app without an LLM: can generate custom feedback and examples rather than relying on rigid rules.\n",
    "* Compared to human support: cheaper and available 24/7 for practice; humans still needed for nuanced coaching and speaking pronunciation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific tasks the chatbot will perform:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Correct grammar and sentence structure in submitted text.\n",
    "2. Suggest higher-level vocabulary and collocations with examples.\n",
    "3. Provide a model answer or model speaking response.\n",
    "4. Give a band-level estimate (with justification and actionable Next Steps).\n",
    "5. Provide short drills or mini-tasks to improve a specific weakness.\n",
    "6. Fallback: answer \"I don’t know / refer to resources\" for out-of-domain queries.\n",

    "# 3) Select the LLM (Groq): model choice and justification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Models Groq supports (examples):** Llama 3 family, Mixtral variants, Gemma family. Groq is optimized for low-latency inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended model for this use case:** `llama-3-8b` (or `mixtral-8x7b` if you prefer Mixtral).\n",
    "**Why `llama-3-8b`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Quality:** Good language performance on English tasks (grammar, paraphrase, instructions) while being much less expensive than the 70B models.\n",
    "* **Latency/cost:** 8B models run faster and cheaper on Groq hardware which is useful for an interactive chat app like this.\n",
    "* **Real-time UX:** Lower latency improves user experience in Streamlit.\n",
    "* **Multilingual support:** Decent for English and common languages; if you need specialized non-English support choose a larger model or a multilingual model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tradeoffs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Larger models (e.g., `llama-3-70b`) will likely yield subtlely better feedback and more accurate band estimates, but will cost more and increase latency. For a student-facing MVP, 8B strikes a good balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you need heavy reasoning and nuance (e.g., high-stakes exam coaching)**, consider `llama-3-70b` but only if budget and latency are acceptable.\n",

    "# 4) Conversation flow design (planned before code)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Greeting / Goodbye / Session\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Greeting**: Bot opens with: “Hi — I’m your IELTS instructor. What would you like to practice: Speaking or Writing?”\n",
    "* **Goodbye**: “Good practice session! Keep working on X. Come back when you want another review.”\n",
    "* **Session memory**: Session-level short-term memory (last N messages / last 3 user weakness tags). Optional persistent memory if user opts-in (store user proficiency level / preferred practice type).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How unknown questions are handled\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bot replies: “I’m focused on IELTS Speaking and Writing. For that I can help with grammar, vocabulary, essay structure and band estimates. For other topics, I can try — but may be inaccurate.”\n",
    "* If out-of-scope ask: provide a concise referral (e.g., “For pronunciation practice upload audio to an STT/TTS-enabled tool or consult a human tutor.”).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context & memory policy\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Short-term:** Keep last 8–10 messages (sliding window) to maintain context for follow-ups.\n",
    "* **Long-term (opt-in):** Remember user level (e.g., “approx band 5.5”), weaknesses (e.g., “grammar: articles”), and preferred task (speaking/writing) only if user explicitly asks to store it. (Respect privacy.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample user inputs and expected responses\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User: “Can you correct this Task 2 essay? *\\[essay text]*”\n",
