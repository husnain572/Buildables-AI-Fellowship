    "\n",
    "This report examines how the Australian workforce changed between 1945 and 2000. It highlights four major themes: the rapid rise of women’s workforce participation (especially married women), the influx of migrants and their ongoing employment challenges, the shift from rural and manufacturing work to service-oriented “white collar” industries, and the sharp increase in unemployment linked to demographic and socio-economic factors. Drawing on Australian Bureau of Statistics data and secondary literature, the report frames these shifts as both opportunities (greater diversity, new job sectors) and challenges (displacement by technology, long-term unemployment).\n",

    "**2️⃣ Shorter Summary (3 bullet points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Women & Migrants:** Women, especially married women, moved into paid work in unprecedented numbers, while migrants filled post-war labor gaps but often faced high unemployment and low-skill roles.\n",
    "* **Industry Shift:** Australia transitioned from agriculture/manufacturing to a service and technology economy, reducing labor-intensive jobs and increasing demand for skilled workers.\n",
    "* **Unemployment Rise:** From near-full employment post-WWII to high and persistent unemployment by the 1990s, shaped by age, English proficiency, geography, and socio-economic background.\n",

    "**3️⃣ Single Sentence (main trend/insight)**\n",

    "Australia’s post-WWII workforce evolved from a male-dominated, industrial base with full employment into a more diverse, service-oriented economy marked by rising female participation but persistent migrant disadvantage and higher unemployment.\n",
