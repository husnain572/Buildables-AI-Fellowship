      "**Medieval History (500 - 1500 CE):**\n",
      "In the medieval period, Pakistan was ruled by various Muslim dynasties, including the Ghaznavids, Ghurids, and Delhi Sultanate. The region was a major center of trade, culture, and learning, with cities like Lahore and Multan becoming important hubs.\n",

      "**Mughal Era (1526 - 1756 CE):**\n",
      "The Mughal Empire, founded by Babur, ruled Pakistan for over two centuries. During this period, the region experienced a golden age of culture, architecture, and art. The Mughals built many iconic monuments, including the Badshahi Mosque and the Lahore Fort.\n",

      "**British Colonial Era (1849 - 1947 CE):**\n",
      "In the mid-19th century, Pakistan was colonized by the British East India Company.

The country faced major challenges from the beginning, including a shortage of resources, migration of millions of refugees, and administrative difficulties. Despite these hardships, Pakistan quickly established its government institutions, with Liaquat Ali Khan as the first Prime Minister and Muhammad Ali Jinnah as the first Governor-General. In 1956, Pakistan adopted its first constitution, becoming the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The country experienced periods of democracy and military rule throughout its history. In 1971, East Pakistan separated and became Bangladesh after a civil war. Today, Pakistan is known for its rich culture, strong military, and significant role in South Asian politics.\n",
