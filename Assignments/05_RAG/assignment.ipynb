      "**Medieval History (500 - 1500 CE):**\n",

      "**Mughal Era (1526 - 1756 CE):**\n",
      "The Mughal Empire, founded by Babur, ruled Pakistan for over two centuries. During this period, the region experienced a golden age of culture, architecture, and art. The Mughals built many iconic monuments, including the Badshahi Mosque and the Lahore Fort.\n",

      "**British Colonial Era (1849 - 1947 CE):**\n",
      "In the mid-19th century, Pakistan was colonized by the British East India Company.
